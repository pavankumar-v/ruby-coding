# Design Pattern

Design Patterns, initially when I heard about this, it sounded very complex and I could never give it try.

But some how in my journey of building features and researching about best practices in programming is when I started looking into desing patterns with some examples, some made sense, some did not and I could not relate to my work anytime soon.

Surprisingly I got an interesting feature to work on, that's when when my Engineering Lead gave hint about a pattern to check out, which was _Adapter Design Pattern_ and the feature was integrating external API service to our application. YES! you heard it right.

Enough Talks! My main ajenda is share you guys real world examples of every design pattern. You might have come across many of these modules in your journey, but you would not have realized that design patterns are being used in those areas

_Note: **Desing Patterns** are not specific to any language, they are more like a protocol or best practice rules_

## Real World Examples

Before I jump into listing desing pattern, I will introduce you guys to some real world examples, which should make practical sense while learning.

These examples will be used in the demonstration too.

1. A SQL Database client, connecting to MySQL, Postgres or any SQL DB's using Adapter Desing Pattern
